# Security Risk Report - Executive Summary

**Project**: TaskFlow
**Date**: 2026-01-20
**Classification**: Confidential
**Prepared By**: Threat Modeling Toolkit

---

## Overview

This security assessment identified **15 threats** across **5 system components** in the TaskFlow application. **4 threats** are rated as **critical** and require immediate attention.

The application demonstrates good foundational security practices (password hashing, parameterized queries, JWT authentication) but has significant gaps in access control, authentication hardening, and security monitoring.

**Overall Risk Level**: HIGH

---

## Key Metrics

| Metric | Value | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Total Threats | 15 | |
| Critical Threats | 4 | Immediate action required |
| Security Controls | 15 | 33% fully implemented |
| Security Gaps | 10 | 3 critical, 5 high |
| OWASP Compliance | 52% | Below target (80%) |
| SOC2 Compliance | 48% | Below target (70%) |

---

## Critical Findings

| # | Finding | Risk | Business Impact |
|---|---------|------|-----------------|
| 1 | **Broken Object-Level Authorization** | Critical (16) | Any user can modify/delete other users' tasks |
| 2 | **Missing Multi-Factor Authentication** | Critical (16) | Account takeover with single credential compromise |
| 3 | **Credential Stuffing Vulnerability** | Critical (16) | Mass account compromise using leaked credentials |
| 4 | **Password Reset Flood** | High (15) | Service disruption, email spam, cost increase |

---

## Compliance Status

```
OWASP Top 10 2021:  ██████░░░░  52%
SOC2 Trust Services: █████░░░░░  48%
```

**Critical Compliance Gaps:**
- A01: Broken Access Control (15%)
- A04: Insecure Design (0%)
- A09: Security Logging Failures (0%)

## Recommendations

### Immediate Priority (Week 1)
1. **Fix BOLA vulnerabilities** - Add ownership checks to PUT/DELETE task endpoints
2. **Add rate limiting** - Apply existing rate limiter to forgot-password endpoint

### Short-term Priority (Week 2-4)
3. **Implement security logging** - Add audit trail for authentication and access events
4. **Add CSRF protection** - Implement CSRF tokens for state-changing operations
5. **Enforce password policy** - Require minimum 12 characters with complexity

### Medium-term Priority (Month 2-3)
6. **Implement MFA** - Add TOTP-based two-factor authentication
7. **Add account lockout** - Lock accounts after repeated failed login attempts

---

## Resource Estimate

| Priority | Items | Estimated Effort |
|----------|-------|------------------|
| Immediate | 2 | 1-2 days |
| Short-term | 3 | 1-2 weeks |
| Medium-term | 2 | 2-4 weeks |
| **Total** | **7** | **4-8 weeks** |

## Next Steps

1. Review this report with the development team
2. Prioritize remediation based on business risk
3. Schedule security fixes for the next sprint
4. Re-run threat assessment after remediation
5. Establish baseline for ongoing security monitoring
